# CSC212 Self-Assessment Programs

This repository contains my solutions for several CSC212 (Data Structures) self-assessment exercises. Each program focuses on core algorithmic reasoning, input handling, and implementing logic without external libraries.

## Programs

### 1. Sudoku Checker  
File: `main_1.py`  
Validates a 9×9 Sudoku solution by checking rows, columns, and 3×3 sub-boxes for duplicates.  

---

### 2. Game of Life Simulator  
File: `main_2.py`  
Implements Conway’s Game of Life. Reads the initial grid, simulates multiple generations, and prints the final state.  
Features grid extension, neighbor counting, and applying classic Game of Life rules.  

---

### 3. Sliding Puzzle Simulator (3×3)  
File: `main_3.py`  
Simulates a 3×3 sliding puzzle using a sequence of commands (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).  
Moves the blank tile according to the commands and checks if the final state matches the solved configuration.  

---

### 4. k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier  
File: `main_4.py`  
A simple KNN classifier that computes Euclidean distances for all points, selects the k closest, and returns a class prediction (`R` or `B`).
